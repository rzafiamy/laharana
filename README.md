# Laharana: Pirate Number Tracker

Laharana is a community-driven application designed to track and manage **pirate or harmful phone numbers**. Users can contribute by adding suspicious numbers, voting, or downvoting existing entries to help identify and flag potentially dangerous or fraudulent phone numbers. This app empowers users to protect themselves and others by sharing information about harmful numbers in a collaborative and transparent way.

## Features

### 1. **Add Pirate Numbers**
   - Users can add new pirate or harmful phone numbers to the database.
   - Each entry includes:
     - Phone number
     - Location (optional)
     - Description (optional)

### 2. **Vote and Downvote**
   - Users can vote (`üëç`) or downvote (`üëé`) existing entries to indicate their validity.
   - The number of votes determines the credibility of each entry.

### 3. **View Pirate Numbers**
   - A list of all reported numbers is displayed, sorted by the number of votes.
   - Each entry shows:
     - Phone number
     - Location
     - Number of votes
     - A visual vote bar to indicate the level of community trust.

### 4. **Search and Filter**
   - Users can search for specific numbers or filter entries by location.

### 5. **Alert System**
   - A beautiful **AlertModal** is used to display messages (e.g., success, errors, or warnings) in a visually appealing way.

## How It Works

1. **Add a Number**:
   - Use the form to add a new pirate or harmful phone number.
   - Provide details such as the number, location, and description.

2. **Vote on Numbers**:
   - Browse the list of reported numbers.
   - Vote (`üëç`) if you believe the number is harmful.
   - Downvote (`üëé`) if you think the number is safe or incorrectly flagged.

3. **Track Pirate Numbers**:
   - The app dynamically updates the list based on user votes.
   - Numbers with higher votes are highlighted as more credible.

4. **Stay Informed**:
   - Use the search and filter features to find specific numbers or locations.
